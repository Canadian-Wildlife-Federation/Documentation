We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.0 of the CABD (CABD 1.0), which includes complete national coverage for three types of data across Canada:

#.	Dams
#.	Waterfalls
#.	Fishways

You can also now explore, filter, and download the data through the CABD web tool! Weâ€™re continuing to work hard to fill data gaps and incorporate additional barrier types (e.g., stream crossings) in the CABD, so stay tuned and check back here periodically for new updates and data releases.
