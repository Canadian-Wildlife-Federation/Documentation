The Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) has developed the Canadian Fish Passage Assessment (CANFISHPASS) mobile app to help improve the Canadian Aquatic Barriers Database (CABD)—Canada’s centralized, open-access resource for data on aquatic structures like dams, stream crossings, waterfalls, and fishways—and engage Canadians and local communities in action to help support freshwater conservation and restoration. 

The CABD app can be downloaded for `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foundry.cabdapp>`_ or iOS devices. 

.. note::
    
    The CANFISHPASS app is a separate and distinct product from the Canadian Fish Passage Database (CanFishPass database). 
    
    The CanFishPass database is an electronic inventory of fish passage facilities in Canada, developed by the Fish Ecology and Conservation Physiology Laboratory at Carleton University and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The searchable CanFishPass database contains detailed geo-referenced information about information on engineering and hydraulic specifications, and the biological effectiveness of engineered fishways to support future projects in Canada. More information about the project can be found here: https://www.fecpl.ca/projects/canfishpass-inventory-of-canadian-fish-passage-facilities/. 
    
    The CanFishPass database was foundation for the CABD Fishways dataset, and CWF is dedicated to maintaining and improving the fishway inventory in the future. 

Purpose of the App
-------------------
Despite being the most comprehensive aquatic barrier inventory in Canada, the CABD isn’t perfect! We’ve compiled information from over 800 existing sources, but data gaps still exist – we are going to be missing structures in our datasets and key information for many existing points. Filling these data gaps is a huge job because we need to visit these structures on the ground to confirm whether they exist and evaluate whether they are barriers to fish passage. With hundreds of thousands of potential barriers, CWF can’t do this alone so we’re hoping people across Canada can help! CANFISHPASS allows anyone to visit the location of these structures and perform quick, easy assessments to contribute key information and improve the CABD, which will be used the inform infrastructure management and freshwater connectivity restoration planning. 

By answering a few simple questions and taking photos of the site using the app, users can help us: 

- Confirm the existence of dams and stream crossings  on the landscape and identify unmapped structures. 
- Collect basic information and photos to help us learn more about the structure and photos, including classifying what type of structure it is.. 
- Broadly assess whether these structures are barriers to passage for fish and aquatic species. 
- Engage Canadians to raise awareness of the impact aquatic barriers have on freshwater ecosystems and inspire action to support barrier rehabilitation and connectivity conservation and restoration initiatives. 

Who It's For
------------
Everyone! CANFISHPASS turns every user into a community scientist. This can be people who already spend a lot of time on the landscape (e.g., hikers, anglers, paddlers, or other outdoor enthusiasts), or anyone out for a walk in their neighbourhood.  We’ve built the app to be easy to  use, and it includes detailed guidance on how to answer each question and take photos. There is no specialized training or equipment is required—just a smartphone and a bit of curiosity! 

Why It Matters
---------------
Freshwater ecosystems are maintained by flows that regulate water temperature, distribute food and nutrients, and facilitate the movements and migrations of fish and other aquatic species. Unfortunately, aquatic barriers, like dams and stream crossings (e.g., culverts), disrupt these processes and impede fish passage, fragmenting freshwater habitat. The first step in addressing these issues is to map and identify barriers. This helps us understand the scope of the problem, advocate for change, and prioritize barriers for ecological restoration. 

Every assessment submitted through CANFISHPASS will be directly integrated into the CABD datasets, helping to ensure that practitioners and decision makers have access to the best available data to inform conservation, restoration, and infrastructure asset management and confidently take meaningful action to replace problematic structures with nature-based designs, while increasing the resiliency of both the infrastructure and ecosystems.
