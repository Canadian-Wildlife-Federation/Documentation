The Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) has developed the CABD Rapid Barrier Assessment mobile app to support the Canadian Aquatic Barriers Database (CABD)—Canada’s centralized, open-access resource for data on aquatic barriers like dams, stream crossings, waterfalls, and fishways.

The CABD app can be downloaded via :ref:`Android <android-user-guide>` or :ref:`iOS <ios-user-guide>` devices. 

Purpose of the App
-------------------
The app is designed to:

- Confirm the presence of aquatic barriers on the landscape.
- Identify and classify types of structures (initially focusing on dams and stream crossings).
- Collect basic details (e.g., visibility, flow obstruction, structure material) and photos.
- Flag unmapped or potentially non-existent structures.
- Help broadly assess the passability of barriers for fish and aquatic species.
- Engage community scientists and the public to raise awareness and support barrier restoration and connectivity initiatives.

Who It's For
------------
The app is built for community scientists and people already on the landscape—such as hikers, anglers, paddlers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. No specialized training or equipment is required—just a smartphone and a bit of curiosity!

Why It Matters
---------------
Aquatic barriers can severely impact freshwater ecosystems and species by:

- Disrupting fish migration routes.
- Altering water flow and sediment transport.
- Fragmenting habitats.

By contributing quick and easy field observations, users help improve our understanding of Canada’s aquatic connectivity and contribute directly to conservation and restoration planning.
