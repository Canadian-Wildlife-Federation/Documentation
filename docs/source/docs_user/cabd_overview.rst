CABD Overview

*Still working on this*

What is the CABD?
-----------------

The CABD is a standardized, curated, central, and open database for barrier and connectivity data in Canada. Currently, the CABD 1.0 offers four types of data:

#.	Dams
#.	Waterfalls
#.	Fishways
#.	Hydrographic (stream and river) networks (coming soon!).

We know that aquatic barriers are prevalent across Canada, that barrier removal is needed to restore connectivity and access to vital habitat for aquatic species, and that restoration projects are expensive. But we donâ€™t have the answers to some important questions: How many barriers exist in Canada? How much habitat is not accessible for fish and other species? How do we identify the most important barriers to restore and maximize benefits for these species? We need a comprehensive information source to answer these questions, which is where the CABD comes in! The CABD will allow CWF and other organizations across the country to assess and report on the status of habitat connectivity and inform management and regulatory decisions relating to infrastructure construction and management. It also supports barrier restoration planning and prioritization of projects to improve connectivity and fish passages for important species. Additionally, the database will inform research and monitoring initiatives to better understand the effects these barriers have on freshwater ecosystems and the species they support and provide a national forum for sharing resources, best practices, and success stories to support education and public outreach.
