**September 25, 2022**

We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.0 of the CABD (CABD 1.0), which is the baseline version and includes complete national coverage for three types of data across Canada:

#.	Dams v1.0
#.	Waterfalls v1.0
#.	Fishways v1.0

You can also now explore, filter, and download the data through the CABD web tool! Weâ€™re continuing to work hard to fill data gaps and incorporate additional barrier types (e.g., stream crossings) in the CABD, so stay tuned and check back here periodically for new updates and data releases.
