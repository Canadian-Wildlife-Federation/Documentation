**May 15, 2023**

The CABD web tool has been updated to make searching, filtering, and visualizing data easier and faster for our users.

*   You can now search by structure name, facility name, and cabd_id.
*   Decimal degree coordinates are now entered in a single box when searching by latitude and longitude.
*   Filtering by watershed has been improved to address issues with selecting and deselecting watersheds from the map.
*   After applying filters, you will now see a count of the filtered features out of the total count of features available in the CABD.
*   When downloading data, the default option will be to download a filtered version of the dataset with any filters you have applied. If you have not applied any filters, this will download the full dataset.

In addition to these UI improvements, several updates were made to dams and waterfalls in BC and PEI based on new information from local groups. Please see the :ref:`Data Releases <data-releases>` table for more information on these changes.

**September 25, 2022**

We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.0 of the CABD (CABD 1.0), which is the baseline version and includes complete national coverage for three types of data across Canada:

#.	Dams v1.0
#.	Waterfalls v1.0
#.	Fishways v1.0

You can also now explore, filter, and download the data through the CABD web tool! Weâ€™re continuing to work hard to fill data gaps and incorporate additional barrier types (e.g., stream crossings) in the CABD, so stay tuned and check back here periodically for new updates and data releases.
