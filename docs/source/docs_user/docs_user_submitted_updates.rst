Submit Data Updates
===================

We are working hard to fill existing data gaps in the CABD, but filling these data gaps is a huge job and we’re hoping people across Canada can help! We’re working on some new tools to allow users to submit information through the CABD web tool, but in the meantime you can submit updates to the attribute information for features in the CABD (i.e., a dam, waterfall, or fishway) by sharing the information with the CABD team via email (see below for details).

We’ll compile and release data updates in bulk periodically (every few months), so check out our :ref:`Data Releases <data-releases>` section for the latest updates!

Submitting Updates via Email
----------------------------

-----

Currently, the easiest way to submit updates to the CABD is to send us an email at cabd@cwf-fcf.org.

.. important::
    
    To help us identify your submission as quickly as possible, please use the following as the email subject line: "CABD - User Submitted Updates".

The body of the email **must** include:

* The unique identifier (cabd_id) of the feature to be updated. This can be acquired through the web mapping tool by clicking on the point feature of the structure of interest, which will open the 'Attributes' popup window. Copy and paste the value provided for 'Barrier Identifier', or 'System Identifier' if the structure is a fishway.

* A URL link for the information source, if applicable. If the the information you are looking to provide comes from personal knowledge, that works too! We just ask that you include your name and organization (if applicable) in the email.

* A detailed explanation of the information to be updated.

Once received, our team will review the content and update the database with the provided information.

.. note::

    If you are interested in submitting more detailed updates to the CABD, please reach out to us at cabd@cwf-fcf.org
