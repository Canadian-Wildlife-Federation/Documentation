Submit Data Updates
===================

We are working hard to fill existing data gaps in the CABD, but filling these data gaps is a huge job and we’re hoping people across Canada can help! We’re working on some new tools to allow users to submit information through the CABD web tool, but in the meantime you can submit updates to the attribute information for features in the CABD (i.e., a dam, waterfall, or fishway) in one of two ways:

#. Sharing the information with the CABD team via email, or
#. Filling out the appropriate data updates form for the feature being updated (see :ref:`section 2 <section2>` below).

We’ll compile and release data updates in bulk periodically (every few months), so check out our :ref:`Data Releases <data-releases>` section for the latest updates!

1. Submit Updates via Email
---------------------------

-----

Currently, the easiest way to submit updates to the CABD is to send us an email at cabd@cwf-fcf.org.

.. important::
    
    To help us identify your submission as quickly as possible, please use the following as the email subject line: "CABD - User Submitted Updates".

The body of the email **must** include:

* The unique identifier (cabd_id) of the feature to be updated. This can be acquired through the web mapping tool by clicking on the point feature of the structure of interest, which will open the 'Attributes' popup window. Copy and paste the value provided for 'Barrier Identifier', or 'System Identifier' if the structure is a fishway.

* A URL link for the information source, if applicable. If the the information you are looking to provide comes from personal knowledge, that works too! We just ask that you include your name and organization (if applicable) in the email.

* A detailed explanation of the information to be updated.

Once received, our team will review the content and update the database with the provided information.

2. Submit Updates via Microsoft Forms
-------------------------------------

-----

If you are using CABD data for your work, and would like to regularly contribute data updates you can also submit data updates using our Microsoft Form. To access the proper form, select the feature type (dams, waterfalls, or fishways) below for which you would like to submit an update. The appropriate form will open in a new browser tab which you may then fill out and submit. 

Each form contains input fields for all attributes pertaining to that specific feature type and prompts the user for detailed information about the data source, if applicable. A description of each attribute is provided in the form itself. If an attribute has a list of allowable values, options will be provided in a dropdown list.

.. important::

    Submitting data updates via MS form is a more in-depth process than submitting updates by email. 
    
    This option is not recommended for those that do not have a good understanding of the CABD data structure.
