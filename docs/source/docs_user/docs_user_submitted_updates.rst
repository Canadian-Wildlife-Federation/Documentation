Submit Data Updates
===================

A user may submit updates to the attribute information of a feature type record (i.e., a dam, waterfall, or fishway) in one of two way: 
1) sharing the informaion with the CABD team via email, or 2) filling out the appropriate data updates form for the feature being updated (see :ref:`section 2 <section2>` below).

1. Submit Updates via Email
---------------------------

-----

The email should be addressed to cabd@cwf-fcf.org.

.. important::
    
    To help us identify your submission as quickly as possible, please use the following as the email subject line: "CABD - User Submitted Updates".

The body of the email **must** include:

* The unique identifier (cabd_id) of the feature to be updated. This can be acquired through the web mapping tool by clicking on the point feature of the structure of interest, which will open the 'Attributes' popup window. Copy and paste the value provided for 'Barrier Identifier', or 'System Identifier' if the structure is a fishway.

* A URL link for the information source, if applicable.

* A detailed explanation of the information to be updated.

Once received, our team will review the content and update the database with the provided information.

2. Submit Updates via MS Form
-----------------------------

-----

To submit data updates using an MS form, select the feature type (dams, waterfalls, or fishways) below that you would like to submit an update for. The required MS form will open in a new browser tab which you may then fill out and submit. 

Each form contains input fields for all attributes pertaining to that specific feature type and prompts the user for detailed information about the data source, if applicable. A description of each attribute is provided in the form itself. If an attribute has a list of allowable values, options will be provided in a downdown list.

.. note::

    Submitting data updates via MS form is a more in-depth process than submitting updates by email. 
    
    This option is not recommended for those that do not have a good understanding of the CABD data structure.
