Code,Name,Description
1,Storage  ,"A structure built to store water during times of high flow for a variety of purposes (e.g., water supply, irrigation etc.). "
2,Diversion  ,A structure built to divert all or some of the water from a waterway into a man-made canal or conduit.  
3,Detention  ,"A structure built for flood control. Retains excess water in a reservoir to maintain the carrying capacity of the waterway, releasing it gradually at a controlled rate to protect downstream areas from flooding. "
4,Debris  ,"A structure built across a waterway to retain debris (e.g., driftwood, gravel, sand etc.)."
5,Coffer  ,An enclosed temporary structure commonly used during construction. Water is pumped from the enclosure to provide a dry worksite.
6,Saddle  ,"An auxiliary structure constructed at low spots along the perimeter of a reservoir to limit its extent, or to allow for an increase in storage capacity. "
7,Hydro - Closed-cycle pumped storage ,A facility configured to pump water between two water reservoirs at different elevations; both reservoirs are isolated from a free-flowing water source.
8,Hydro - Conventional storage ,"A facility that impounds water, which when released, flows through a turbine and generates electricity.  "
9,Hydro - Open-cycle pumped storage ,A facility configured to pump water between two water reservoirs at different elevations; a free-flowing water source is used for either the upper or lower reservoir.
10,Hydro - Run-of-river ,A facility that channels flowing water from a river through a canal or penstock to spin a turbine. 
11,Hydro - Tidal ,A facility configured to intake and store water during high tide and slowly release it back into the ocean during low tide. 
12,Other  ,The function of the dam cannot be defined by the types listed in this table. 
13,Unknown  ,No information is known regarding the function of the dam structure/facility.
