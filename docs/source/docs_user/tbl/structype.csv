1,Dam - Arch,"A structure, typically made of concrete, that is curved to form a horizontal arch with its convex side in the upstream direction."
2,Dam - Buttress,"A buttress dam, sometimes referred to as a hallow dam, is a structure made of concrete or masonry that consists of inclined panels or a series of arches supported by buttresses on its downstream side."
3,Dam - Embankment,"A structure constructed by building up and compacting several layers of excavated earth and/or rock. This category includes causeways."
4,Dam - Gravity,"A structure, typically made of concrete and/or masonry, that relies on the weight of its materials to withstand external forces."
5,Dam - Multiple Arch,"A buttress dam composed of a series of multiple arches."
6,Dam - Other,"The type of dam is known, but is different than those defined in this table (e.g., arch-gravity, sheet pile, timber crib, etc.)."
7,Weir,"A type of low-head dam that allows the flow of water over the top of or underneath the structure. A weir may be used to raise the water level upstream, regulate flow, or divert flow from the system."
8,Spillway,"A structure that allows for the emergency or controlled release of surplus water downstream of a dam or other barrier structure."
9,Powerhouse,"A hydro power facility structure that houses generators and turbines used for generating hydropower."
10,Lateral Barrier,"A structure that is used to regulate or hold back water. Some lateral barrier structures, such as dikes and embankments, run parallel to a body of water and are used to hold back flood waters. Other lateral barriers, like canals, are used to convey water for a specific purpose such as irrigation or navigation."
11,Lock,"A structure, consisting of gates, used on navigable waterways to regulate (raise/lower) the water depth on a stretch of river or stream so vessels may pass."
12,Aboiteau/Tide Gate,"A gate structure used in coastal areas (e.g., marshland), commonly built into an earthen dike or embankment, that permits floodwater to drain during low tide but prevents the overflow of water during high tide."
13,Other,"The type of structure is known, but is different than those defined in this table (e.g., intake structure, lake control structure, etc.)."
99,Unknown,"The type of structure is unknown."
