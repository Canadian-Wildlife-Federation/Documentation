Code,Name,Description
~,Dam - Arch  ,"A structure, typically made of concrete, that is curved in the upstream direction."
~,Dam - Buttress  ,"A structure, typically made of concrete, with a watertight wall supported at intervals on the downstream side by a series of triangle shaped walls."
~,Dam - Earth,A structure composed of successive compacted layers of earth and/or rock.
~,Dam - Gravity  ,"A structure, typically made of concrete and/or masonry, which relies on its weight and internal strength for stability."
~,Dam - Multiple Arch ,A buttress dam composed of a series of arches for the upstream face.
~,Unknown  ,The type of structure is unknown.
~,Other  ,"The type of structure is known, but is different than those defined in this table (e.g., arch-gravity, sheet pile, timber crib, intake structure, etc.)."
~,Weir,A type of low-head dam designed to allow the flow of water over the top of or underneath the structure. Weir structures associated with run-of-river facilities should have a function_code value of 'hydro - run-of-river' (10).
~,Powerhouse,A structure that houses generators and turbines for a hydropower facility. These structures should be assigned the function_code value for the facility it is associated with. 
~,Spillway,A structure that carries excess water over or around a dam or other obstruction. These structures are assigned a function_code value of 'other' (12).
~,Dike/Canal/Embankment,"A structure that runs along or parallel to a body of water to regulate or hold back water, or channel water in a certain direction. These structures are typically assigned a function_code value of 'other' (12)."
~,Lock,"A barrier within a river or canal, typically including gates, which allow the water level on either side of the barrier to be raised or lowered. Commonly used for navigation. These structures are assigned a function_code value of 'other' (12)."
~,Aboiteau/Tide Gate,"A gate through which water can flow when the tide sets in one direction, and automatically closes when the tide sets in the opposite direction. Commonly used in conjunction with earthen dikes or embankments in coastal areas. These structures are assigned a function_code value of 'other' (12)."
