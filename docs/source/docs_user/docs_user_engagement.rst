Stakeholder Engagement
======================

The Canadian Wildlife Federation was interested in developing the CABD to support our growing `national fish passage program <https://cwf-fcf.org/en/explore/fish-passage/>`_, including barrier remediation prioritization analyses; however, the utility of a national-scale database of this nature extends beyond fish passage applications. The creation of a national database and framework to support freshwater connectivity efforts necessitates multilateral collaboration across geographic regions, legislative jurisdictions, and private and public sectors. No such forum existed to facilitate discussions specific to freshwater aquatic connectivity and barrier remediation at a national scale. As such, to support and facilitate the development of the CABD, we established an external stakeholder engagement framework to discuss barriers to aquatic connectivity and fish passage, and to actively engage with interested parties, potential end-users, and data providers, to elicit feedback to help guide the design and development of the CABD.

Stakeholders include representatives from all levels of government, NGOs, local and community groups, researchers, and industry. The stakeholder engagement process has successfully provided advice on feasibility, identification of target end uses and associated data requirements, data acquisition and compilation, database design, and mechanisms to fill data gaps. This stakeholder network supports Canada-wide collaboration on aquatic connectivity, allows for efficient dissemination of information, and ensures that the CABD is a functional tool that can support a range of projects across multiple sectors.

Stakeholder Engagement Framework
--------------------------------

-----

Stakeholder engagement began in 2019, and continues in an activity capacity to this day. The Stakeholder Engagement Framework comprises the following components:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
User Requirements Interviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We developed a standardized questionnaire that was used during phone interviews to help answer some key questions about the database:

- What types of work could the CABD support?
- What feature types and attributes would be most useful to support this work?
- How would potential users like to access the data?

We interviewed over 40 individuals during 2019-20, and the results of these interviews were synthesized to lay out key user requirements and to develop a set of CABD use cases.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CABD User and Advisory Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Practitioner Working Group** (Retired)

The Working Group helped synthesize the results of the stakeholder interviews. The group was responsible for providing feedback and input on (among other topics) target end uses and data requirements, decisions related to project objectives and outcomes, web tool design and functionality, and identifying existing aquatic barrier datasets from spring 2020 to spring 2022. This group has since been amalgamated with the Technical Advisory Committee to form a single advisory committee for the CABD.

**Technical Advisory Committee** (Retired)

The Technical Advisory Committee was responsible for providing feedback and input on technical aspects of project implementation, including but not limited to, database design, logistic consideration for data compilation and mechanisms to fill data gaps, and long-term strategic planning from spring 2020 to spring 2022. The committee also assisted in final decision-making review of products from the Working Group. This group has since been amalgamated with the Practitioner Working Group to form a single advisory committee for the CABD.

**CABD Advisory Committee** (Active)

The Advisory Committee is the active CABD engagement group and is responsible for providing guidance and feedback on strategic planning, data and user requirements, web tool testing, and technical development aspects of project implementation. The committee was established in spring 2022 and is anticipated to remain active with monthly conference calls through 2023.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reciprocal Data-Sharing Relationships
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CABD only exists due to all the painstaking work done by many groups and organizations who have compiled and maintained existing barrier inventories across Canada, and either made them openly available are entered into data-sharing agreements with us. The CABD simply builds off this existing work, and we hope that our work to fill data gaps can benefit original data holders in return. The data-sharing relationships are established between CWF and existing data creators, compilers, and managers. The relationships are reciprocal to ensure mutual benefit, facilitate collaboration, prevent the duplication of efforts, and maintain long-term data currency.

Use Cases
---------

-----

The results of the user requirements interviews were synthesized by the CABD team and discussed with the user and advisory groups to finalize potential end uses for the CABD, data requirements associated with each use, and means of accessing the data. The results of the individual user interviews were synthesized to identify common potential end uses and create broad ‘Use Types’ that encompass related ‘Use Cases’. The following tables summarize the proposed ‘Use Types’ following preliminary synthesis of the stakeholder interview results, including the most commonly identified ‘Use Cases’.
