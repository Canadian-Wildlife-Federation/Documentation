Stakeholder Engagement
======================

CWF is interested in developing this database to support barrier remediation prioritization analyses; however, the utility of a national-scale database of this nature extends beyond fish passage applications. The creation of a national database and framework to support freshwater connectivity efforts necessitates multilateral collaboration across geographic regions, legislative jurisdictions, and private and public sectors. No such forum existed to facilitate discussions specific to freshwater aquatic connectivity and barrier remediation at a national scale. As such, to support and facilitate the development of the Canadian Aquatic Barriers Database, CWF has established a national stakeholder engagement framework to discuss barriers to aquatic connectivity and fish passage, and to actively engage with interested parties, potential end-users, and data providers, to elicit feedback for the development of the CABD. 

Stakeholder Engagement Framework
--------------------------------

-----

The Stakeholder Engagement Framework comprises four components:

1.	*User requirements interviews* – A standardized questionnaire used during phone interviews to elicit feedback on database value and types of use, scale of work, and data requirements and access. The user requirement interviews were completed during the fiscal year 2019-20.

2.	*CABD Working Group* – The Working Group aided in the synthesis of the results of the stakeholder interviews. The group is responsible for providing feedback and input on (among other topics) target end uses and data requirements, decisions related to project objectives and outcomes, and existing aquatic barrier datasets. The group remains active with monthly conference calls.

3.	*CABD Technical Advisory Committee* – The Technical Advisory Committee assists in final decision-making review of products from the Working Group. The committee is responsible for providing feedback and input on technical aspects of project implementation, including but not limited to, database design, logistic consideration for data compilation and mechanisms to fill data gaps, and long-term strategic planning. The committee remains active with monthly conference calls.

4.	*Reciprocal data-sharing relationships* – The data-sharing relationships are established between CWF and existing data creators, compilers, and managers. The relationships are reciprocal to ensure mutual benefit, facilitate collaboration, prevent the duplication of efforts, and maintain long-term data currency. 

Stakeholders include representatives from all levels of government, NGOs, local and community groups, researchers, and industry. The stakeholder engagement process has successfully provided advice on feasibility, identification of target end uses and associated data requirements, data acquisition and compilation, database design, and mechanisms to fill data gaps. This stakeholder network supports Canada-wide collaboration on aquatic connectivity, allows for efficient dissemination of information, and ensures that the CABD is a functional tool that can support a range of projects across multiple sectors.
