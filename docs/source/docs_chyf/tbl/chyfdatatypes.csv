Dataset  ,Description  
EFlowpath ,An elementary flowpath is a derived linear feature representing the path of water from one hydro node to another.  
EFlowpath Attribute ,A table for storing additional attributes associated with eflowpath. 
ECatchment  ,The term elementary catchment refers to a feature with polygonal geometry that defines a fundamental drainage area (includes waterbodies).  
ECatchment Attribute ,A table for storing additional attributes associated with ecatchment. 
Nexus (system-generated) ,A node or a vertex existing at each endpoint of a flowpath. This dataset will be generated by the loading tools and users are not required to provide it. 
AOI ,Working units for managing data. 
Shoreline ,Linear spatial representation representing the boundary between land and sea.  
Terminal Point ,"Where a flowpath (first or last) endpoint touches the AOI boundary at a vertex on the boundary, a terminal point exists. This is not specifically required for the CHyF services but will be useful when updating/replacing/merging datasets. "
Names ,A table tracking unique names with an identifier.
