Welcome to the Canadian Aquatic Barriers Database (CABD) documentation site!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*All of Canadaâ€™s aquatic barrier and freshwater connectivity information in one place -- easily and openly accessible!*

The CABD is a standardized, curated, central, and open repository for barrier and connectivity data in Canada. It is a tool to support work in a variety of fields and sectors related to freshwater connectivity and aquatic barriers. The database is accessible via our web tool at `aquaticbarriers.ca <https://aquaticbarriers.ca/>`_.

This is your one-stop-shop to learn how about the CABD, how to access and use the data, and help us fill data gaps and improve the database. The site is divided into two sections:

#. CABD User Resources
#. CABD Technical Documentation

Head to the **CABD User Resources** section if you are interested in exploring:

- The latest :ref:`announcements and data releases <whats-new>`
- An :ref:`overview of the CABD project <cabd-overview>` and uses for the data
- :ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>` on how to use the web tool and access data
- The :ref:`data sources <data-sources>` used to develop the CABD
- The :ref:`definitions <data-catalogue>` of the data layers and associated attributes
- How to help us :ref:`fill data gaps <submit-updates>` by submitting user updates
- The :ref:`engagement process <stakeholder-engagement>` that supported the development of the CABD and associated tools

If you're interested in diving into the more technical aspects of the database, check out the **CABD Technical Documentation** section for resources, including:

- An overview of the :ref:`database and application architecture <cabd-models>`
- How to access CABD data and data sources via :ref:`REST API services <cabd-rest-services>`

The CABD is a collaborative project developed and maintained by the Canadian Wildlife Federation, you can visit our `website <https://cwf-fcf.org/en/explore/fish-passage/?src=menu>`_ to learn more about our work supporting freshwater connectivity and fish passage.
