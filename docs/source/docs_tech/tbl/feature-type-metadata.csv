data_type,"The data type for the attribute. Valid values: varchar(xxx), text, boolean, array(type), integer, double, uuid, date, geometry."
value_options_reference,"For columns that have a defined list of valid values in another database table (for example: ``province_territory_code``), this field identifies what table the values can be loaded from and what fields in the table provide the value, name, and description. This column should be null for fields that don’t reference tables.

The string should be of the form ``<tablename>;<valuefield>;<namefield>;<descriptionfield>;<geometryfield>``. Only ``tablename`` and ``namefield`` are required, all others can be blank.  The ``tablename`` references the code table, the ``valuefield`` the value field in the code table, the ``namefield`` the human friendly name field in the table, and ``descriptionfield`` the description field in the table. The name and description fields should exclude the language suffix and each reference table should have both _en and _fr columns for the name and description fields. The ``geometryfield`` is for tables that include geometry boundaries (nhn_workunit) and for whose bounding box extends we want included in the metadata. If supplied the metadata output includes bbox field representing the bounding box of the geometry in lat/long (SRID 4617).

For example: ``dams.use_codes;code;name;description`` or ``cabd.province_territory_codes;code;name;`` or ``cabd.nhn_workunit;id;name;;polygon``"
