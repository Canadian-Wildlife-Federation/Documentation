size,"The size of the feature. For linear features this will be the length in meters, for polygons features this will be the area in square meters. "
rank,The rank associated with the feature (primary/secondary). This only applies to linear flowpath features. See rank attribute in the CHyF Data Model documentation for more information.
strahler_order,"The strahler order associated with the feature. For waterbody features this will be the maximum strahler order of all the skeleton lines associated with the waterbody. Strahler order is only calculated for primary reach, infrastructure, and skeleton flowpaths. It will be null for all other flowpaths and waterbodies which don't contain one of these features. "
name_en,The English name associated with the feature 
name_fr,The French name associated with the feature
